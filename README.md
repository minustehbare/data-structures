# Data structures

This is a simple repository for me to fiddle with creating (possibly bad)
implementations of classic data structures.

There really is not anything more to say than that, but I plan to implement
things like:
  * Array
  * Linked List
  * Stack
  * Queue
  * Tree (generic, binary, binary search, red-black, etc.)
  * Heap
  * Hash Table
  * Graph (directed, undirected, weighted)
  * Trie
  * Linked Hash Map
  
Implementations will be in Ruby and unit tests created with RSpec.
